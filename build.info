  Introduction
  ============
  The project PrototypeDemo is an implementation of:
   - 'creational' Design Pattern Prototype
  Design Patterns are the basic building blocks for creating maintainable software.

  Designing object-oriented software is hard, and designing reusable object-oriented software is even harder.
  Experienced object-oriented designers will tell you that a reusable and flexible design is difficult
  if not impossible to get "right" the first time.
  Before a design is finished, they usually try to reuse it several times, modifying it each time.

  The given implementation is made with the following purpose:
   1. Complete working example of the pattern written in C++.
   2. Complete building by the client with make and C++
   3. No External Libraries needed.
   4. The code-example is made to explain the pattern in C++ and not to explain C++.

   How to use
   ==========
   The following actions are required:
   - Extract Archive-file into a directory of your choice.
   - Open a terminal window (UNIX) or a DOS Command window (Windows).
   - Goto the directory containing the files 'makefile' and 'build.info'
   - Execute the command 'make' to run almost all available commands.

   Requirements
   ============
    C++ Compiler
      Read the page:
      - UNIX    : https://arachnoid.com/cpptutor/setup_unix.html
      - Windows : https://arachnoid.com/cpptutor/setup_windows.html
    GNU Make
      Read the information on the website https://www.gnu.org/software/make
    Doxygen Document generator
      The makefile generates also doxygen documentation if Doxygen is installed.
